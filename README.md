# OnTheMap
This app allows Udacity students to share their location and a link they enjoy with each other.

You are first prompted to login. This can be done with your regular Udacity credentials, or you can also login with Facebook if your Udacity account has been linked to your Facebook account.

Once you are logged in, you will see a map that displays the location of the last 100 posts by Udacity students. You can also see this information displayed in a table view by selecting the table view tab. Selecting pins or rows will direct you to the link that the user shared when posting.

There is also an option to post your own location with a link. Once you follow the steps of posting, your post will be immediately added to the map and to the top of the table view.
